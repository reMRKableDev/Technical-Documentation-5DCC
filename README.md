# Technical-Documentation-5DCC

Second project completed for the [#5DayCodingChallenge](https://github.com/reMRKableDev/5-day-coding-challenge)

The project is 80% finished. There are still some minor details that need to be fixed like:

- Working menu links for the hamburger menu.
- Menu link sizes for some landscape and tablet modes.
- Container structure in hello-world.html that creates and extended X overflow.
